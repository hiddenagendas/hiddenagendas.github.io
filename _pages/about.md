Five old friends spend 40 minutes of their lives talking shit, buried within that each of them have a hidden topic that they try to direct the conversation towards. If you're interested in some laughs, good friends chatting, and an underlying competition, then this is the podcast for you. If you love terrible sound it's an added bonus!
